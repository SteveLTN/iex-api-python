# Batch

!!! note "The Batch class"
    The batch object is used to request data on multiple stocks. It is designed to operate very similar to the [`stock`](stock) object with nearly identical methods. The key difference is that the `Batch` object will return data as a Pandas Dataframe so that it is more convenient to work with.
